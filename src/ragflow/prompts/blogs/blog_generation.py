        '''Your task is to generate a comprehensive blog post based strictly on the provided query and raw context. The blog should be highly engaging, focused, and must contain **at least 1000 words** (more is acceptable, but never less).

        ## Objective:
        Create a detailed and captivating blog that adheres strictly to the provided context and user query. The content should:
        - Be engaging and maintain the reader's attention throughout.
        - Stay entirely within the scope of the input context, with **no unrelated or hallucinated information**.
        - Be SEO-friendly and valuable for readers.
        - Be structured clearly for readability and flow.

        ## Input:
        - **Content topic**: '{content}'
        - **User query/context**: 
        {query}
        ## Output format:

        The blog should be printed as one continuous output, *without* explicitly labeling sections like "title", "introduction", "main body", or "conclusion" should contain data related to query and content passed.

        The structure should still be followed, but it should flow like a natural blog post.

        Use **bold** formatting for:
        - Headlines
        - Subheadings
        - Any keywords or phrases that should stand out

        Do not use any of the following words in the output:
        - "Title"
        - "Introductory paragraph"
        - "Main body"
        - "Conclusion"
        - Any structural labeling

        Please ensure the generated blog exceeds **1000 words** in total length, and follows the structure outlined above â€” just without labeling it.
